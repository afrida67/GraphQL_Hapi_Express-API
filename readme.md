## A Simple API using GraphQL

**Express.js** and **Hapi.js**, both of them have been used individually.

### Features:
> Query
> Mutation

### Setup: 
```sh
$ npm init
$ npm install
```
As only **back-end** has been implemented, for **front-end**, used **Graphiql**, in-browser IDE 
### Run:
```sh
  $ http://localhost:4000/graphql
```
So, now fetch data from **MongoDB** and do **mutation** i.e create, update, delete :)
